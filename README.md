Uses python 2.
Run python battleship.py to start the game.
battleship.py is the code, the other files are for the images.

Simple game that would involve two people sitting at the same computer, taking turns :P 
Set up pieces, then take turns clicking on spots to attack. First person to sink all the opponent's ships wins.
